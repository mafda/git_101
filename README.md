| Rebase 	| `git rebase <branch>`     	| Similar to Merge but different in the order of committing. In Rebase, your commits in front of the base are temporarily removed. Commits from another branch are applied to your branch, and your commits are finally applied one by one. There may be conflicts that will be resolved for each commit. 	|
| Fetch  	| `git fetch`               	| pull = fetch + merge. Download remote updates but do not apply them to the repository. Lets you rebase a branch instead of merge.
